- Clean and organized! 🎉

**Archive:**
- 11 completed feature/migration summaries
- Historical reference only

**Docs:**
- 7 properly organized developer/feature/planning docs
- Ready for ongoing development

## Next Steps

### Before Committing:
1. ✅ Keep the 5 conversational creation docs for now
2. ✅ Delete `DOCS_CLEANUP_PLAN.md` (this file)
3. ✅ Commit everything together

### After Feature Stabilizes (Future):
Consider consolidating the 5 session docs into:
- `docs/user-guides/CONVERSATIONAL_TICKET_CREATION.md` - User-facing guide
- `docs/developer/CONVERSATIONAL_CREATION_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical deep-dive
- Archive the individual fix docs

## Results

**Before:**
- 21 untracked MD files cluttering root
- Mix of temporary, completed, and current docs
- Hard to find relevant information

**After:**
- 6 relevant docs in root (current feature)
- 11 archived for historical reference
- 7 properly organized in docs/
- Clean, maintainable structure
