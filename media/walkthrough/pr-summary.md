## How It Works

### Generate a PR Summary
Use the command:
**"Linear Buddy: Generate PR Summary"**

Or ask in chat:
```
@devbuddy /pr
```

### Monorepo Intelligence
DevBuddy is built for monorepos and automatically:
- **Detects affected packages** (apps/, packages/, libs/)
- **Analyzes changes per package** separately
- **Shows scope** of your changes
- **Warns** if too many packages are modified

### AI Analysis
The AI examines:
- Git diff across all changed files
- Commit messages and history
- File structure and dependencies
- Code patterns and intent

### PR Template Integration
If you have a PR template (`.github/pull_request_template.md`), DevBuddy:
- **Reads your template** automatically
- **Fills in sections** based on the template structure
- **Preserves formatting** and checkboxes
- **Keeps custom fields** and instructions

## Customization

### Writing Tone
Control how the PR description sounds:
- **Professional** - Clear, formal (default)
- **Casual** - Friendly, approachable
- **Technical** - Detailed, implementation-focused
- **Concise** - Brief, essential info only

**Settings** → **DevBuddy** → **Writing Tone**

### Package Paths
Tell DevBuddy where your packages live:
```json
{
  "devBuddy.packagesPaths": [
    "packages/",
    "apps/",
    "libs/",
    "domains/"
  ]
}
```

**Settings** → **DevBuddy** → **Packages Paths**

### Base Branch
Set your default base branch:
```json
{
  "devBuddy.baseBranch": "main"  // or "master", "develop"
}
```

**Settings** → **DevBuddy** → **Base Branch**

### Max Package Scope
Get warnings if your PR is too large:
```json
{
  "devBuddy.maxPackageScope": 2  // Warn if > 2 packages modified
}
```

**Settings** → **DevBuddy** → **Max Package Scope**

## What Gets Included

The generated PR summary includes:

### Automatic Sections
- **Overview** - High-level description
- **Package Changes** - Per-package breakdown
- **Testing Notes** - How to test
- **Related Tickets** - Linked Linear issues
- **Breaking Changes** - If any
- **Migration Notes** - If needed

### Smart Detection
- Detects if changes are breaking
- Identifies new dependencies
- Highlights security concerns
- Notes database migrations
- Spots configuration changes

## Best Practices

1. **Commit frequently** - Better commit history = better PR summaries
2. **Use descriptive commits** - AI understands context better
3. **Keep PRs focused** - Smaller, single-purpose PRs are easier to describe
4. **Reference tickets** - Include ticket IDs in branch names and commits
5. **Review and edit** - AI generates a draft, you add the final touches

## Integration with GitHub/GitLab

After generating the summary:
1. Copy the generated markdown
2. Create your PR on GitHub/GitLab
3. Paste the summary into the description
4. Add screenshots or additional context
5. Submit!

DevBuddy makes writing thorough PR descriptions effortless, even for large monorepo changes.
