## Workflow States

Linear Buddy shows all workflow states from your team's configuration:

- **$(layers) Backlog** - Not yet started
- **$(circle-outline) Todo** - Ready to start
- **$(play-circle) In Progress** - Currently working
- **$(check-all) Done** - Completed
- **$(circle-slash) Canceled** - No longer needed
- **$(milestone) Triage** - Needs review

The available states match your team's Linear workflow, so you'll see exactly what your team uses.

## Status Indicators

Each status type has a unique icon and color:
- 🔵 **Blue** - In Progress (active work)
- 🟢 **Green** - Done (completed)
- ⚪ **Gray** - Todo/Backlog (not started)
- 🔴 **Red** - Canceled (discontinued)

## Auto-Status Features

Linear Buddy can automatically update status when you:
- **Create a branch** → Offers to move to "In Progress"
- **Complete a ticket** → Updates to "Done"
- **Start work** → Updates to "In Progress"

This keeps your Linear board in sync with your actual development workflow, so your team always knows what you're working on!

## Current Status Highlighting

When changing status, Linear Buddy shows a **(✓ Current)** indicator next to the ticket's current status, making it easy to see where you're moving from.
