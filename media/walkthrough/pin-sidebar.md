# Pin DevBuddy to the Activity Bar

For the best experience, we recommend pinning DevBuddy to your Activity Bar (the icon bar on the left side of VS Code/Cursor).

## How to Pin DevBuddy

1. **Right-click** on the **DevBuddy** icon (checklist icon) in the Activity Bar
2. Select **"Pin to Activity Bar"** or **"Keep in Activity Bar"**

## Alternative Method

If DevBuddy isn't visible in the Activity Bar:

1. Click the **"Views and More Actions..."** button (`⋯` or `≡`) in the Activity Bar
2. Find **DevBuddy** in the list
3. Click to activate it

## Why Pin It?

✅ **Quick access** - One click to see your tickets  
✅ **Visual reminders** - See your work at a glance  
✅ **Seamless workflow** - No need to search for the extension

Once pinned, DevBuddy stays visible and easily accessible whenever you need it!
